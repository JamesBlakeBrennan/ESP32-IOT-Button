# ESP32-IOT-Button
Creating an IOT button with the ESP32

The ESP32 is a powerful and cost efficient SoC developed by Espressif systems. It has a bluetooth module and wifi reciever built directly into the processor which makes it ideal for many IoT applications. In this project I will be using the ESP32 to create a simple IOT button. The ESP32 is ideal for this application because it is cost efficient, energy efficient, and is easy to work with after one familiarizes themselves with the ESP IDF.
